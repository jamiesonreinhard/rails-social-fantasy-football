This app is being created with the goal of bringing a more social aspect to playing fantasy football. The site will allow users to join their respective fantasy leagues, where they'll be able to post power rankings, general posts, league updates, and (of course) smack talk. 


Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
